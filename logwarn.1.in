.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
searches for interesting messages in log files, where ``interesting''
is defined by an
user-supplied list of positive and negative (preceeded with a ``!'') extended regular expressions
provided on the command line.
.Pp
Each log message is compared against each
.Ar pattern
in the order given.
If the log message matches a positive
.Ar pattern
before matching a negative
.Ar !pattern
then it's printed to standard output.
.Pp
.Nm
keeps track of its position between invocations, so each matching line is only ever output once.
It also finds messages in log files that have been rotated (and possibly compressed)
since the previous invocation.
.Pp
.Nm
also includes support for log messages that span multiple lines.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Specify
.Ar dir
as the directory in which
.Nm
will store state information between invocations.
.Pp
The default state directory is
.Pa @DEFAULT_CACHE_DIR@ .
.It Fl h
Output help message and exit.
.It Fl i
Initialize the saved state for
.Ar logfile
as `up to date'.
This causes the next invocation to start its scan at the current
(as of this invocation) end of
.Ar logfile .
.It Fl m
Enable multi-line support.
.Pp
Without this flag, each line in
.Ar logfile
is considered a separate log message.
With this flag, each line in
.Ar logfile
is matched against the extended regular expression
.Ar firstpat ;
non-matching lines are considered continuations of the previous line.
.It Fl n
Normally, if the
.Ar logfile
does not exist,
.Nm
will exit with an error.
This flag causes
.Nm
to treat a non-existent
.Ar logfile
as if it were empty.
.It Fl q
Disable the printing of matching log messages to standard output.
The process exit value can still be used to detect whether there were any matches (see below).
.It Fl r
Make
the extended regular expression
.Ar sufpat
the rotated log file suffix pattern.
.Pp
When
.Nm
detects that a log file has been rotated, it searches for the rotated log file by finding
files in the same directory that have the same name as
.Ar logfile
plus a suffix matching the rotated log file suffix pattern
(if multiple files match, the first one in sorting order is picked).
.Pp
The default rotated log file suffix pattern is
.Pa ^(-[[:digit:]]{8}|\e\.[01])(\e\.(gz|bz2))?$
.It Fl v
Output version information and exit.
.El
.Sh CAVEATS
Log file rotation is detected by comparing filesystem inode numbers, so
.Nm
may exhibit incorrect behavior if (for example) an existing log file is replaced by a copy of itself.
In this situation, use the
.Fl i
flag to reinitialize the saved state.
.Pp
Currently, the supported compression types for rotated files are
.Xr gzip 1
and
.Xr bzip2 1 .
The corresponding executables
.Xr gunzip 1
and
.Xr bunzip2 1
must be present on the user's
.Pa $PATH .
.Pp
The state files in the state directory have names created by taking the
.Ar logfile
from the command line and replacing ``/'' characters with ``_''.
Referring to the same file using different pathnames can result in inconsistent behavior.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Nm
exits with one of the following values:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It 0
No matching log messages were found.
.It 1
One or more matching log messages were found.
.It 2
An error occurred.
