Logwarn - Utility for finding interesting messages in log files

Logwarn searches for "interesting" messages in log files, where "interesting"
is defined in terms of positive and negative regular expressions.

Logwarn has the following features:

    * Regular expressions rules define which lines to include and which
      to exclude, with user-defined rule ordering
    * State is maintained between invocations, so only new log lines are scanned
    * Correct handling of multi-line log messages
    * Tracking of log files that have been rotated, even when the rotated
      log file is compressed
    * Written in C for efficient execution
